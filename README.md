# Anticancer Potential of *Terminalia arjuna* against EGFR – ADMET and Molecular Docking Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the research work from my M.Sc. Biotechnology dissertation, which investigates the **anticancer potential of phytochemicals from _Terminalia arjuna_ against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)**.  
The study utilizes **molecular docking** and **ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) analysis** to identify potential lead compounds for cancer therapy.

---

## 🎯 Research Objective
To evaluate the binding affinity and pharmacokinetic properties of bioactive compounds from _Terminalia arjuna_ and identify potential inhibitors of EGFR for use in anticancer drug development.

---

## 🔬 Methods & Tools Used
- **Phytochemical Selection**: Literature-based screening of bioactive compounds from _Terminalia arjuna_.
- **Protein Target**: EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) — cancer-related molecular target.
- **Molecular Docking**: AutoDock / AutoDock Vina for ligand-receptor interaction studies.
- **ADMET Analysis**: SwissADME, pkCSM for pharmacokinetic profiling and toxicity prediction.
- **Visualization**: PyMOL, Discovery Studio for interaction mapping.

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- Identified several _Terminalia arjuna_ phytochemicals with strong binding affinity to EGFR.
- Conducted ADMET profiling to shortlist compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties.
- Proposed lead molecules with potential for further **in vitro** and **in vivo** validation in cancer therapy research.
